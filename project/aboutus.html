		<p><h4><center> Having difficulty finding a good place to eat? Need suggestions on what food to order? </h4> <br>
If you said yes to any of the questions above, you've come to right place! Foodies Unite is a food review web application, where users can share their food reviews and opinions from different restaurants and vendors in California. You can search by type of food (such as burgers), by store name, or location. If you have any questions, concerns or have anything to report, please contact us through the "Contact Us" page in the sidebar and we will get back to you!

		<p> Please note that our goal is to create a site for users to browse and find new places to eat and to share their thoughts. To maintain this happy and welcoming environment, we ask and emphasize that users post reviews solely on food or overall service. If any posts are reported and do indeed contain inappropriate content, such as criticizing a certain employee in the store (which doesn't pertain to food), they will be removed.
